Front-End Projects Gateway
====================================

Overview
------------------------------------
A Gateway to all my front-end practice projects repositories.

The description shown here for each of them is very brief, so do not hesitate to go read their own README files.

Signup/Login, create/edit/delete your posts, view other people's posts via their URL. Nothing much besides that.

Even though I know the most commonly used module -and automatic way of creating the scaffolding of a react app- is *create-react-app*, it is always better to know how to do anything from the ground up, and that is why this project is here and done the way it is.

[Parcel.js](https://parceljs.org/) was my bundler instead of Webpack, which I would normally use. I chose [Ant design](https://ant.design/) as a styling framework instead of Bootstrap, and [Reach router](https://reach.tech/router) instead of react-router-dom. Do not take me wrong, though. Each mentioned framework/module is awesome and certainly gets its job done, but since I was to build an app from the bare basics, I might as well try some building materials that are new to me too. Why not?

Vanilla Connect 4
------------------------------------
- [Github repository](https://github.com/RenzoMurinaCadierno/VanillaConnect4)

A basic Connect 4 game made with vanilla HTML, CSS and JS.

Place all files inside the same folder and launch the HTML, the game should be automatically playable.

Click on the empty circles to drop the chips. The first one to align 4 diagonally, vertically or horizontally, wins. You can restart the game at any time by refresing the broswer.
